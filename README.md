This group of Java files was a final project for my Java coding class assignment.

The goal of the assignment was to design a game using dice, that would roll until a winner was chosen who passed a score of 250. The player cwould play against 2 "computers"
who would auto roll their dice. The player would be asked after each dice roll if the ywanted to continue in the turn. The game also featres lots of rules about the dice rolls,
and how they would contribute to the score. If a winner was chosen, after passing the point limit, the game would end.

This whole program features 3 different parts: "Module6" which is the main program for the game, "DiceGame" which is the rules for the dice game, "Die" which is the rules for the logic of the dice.
